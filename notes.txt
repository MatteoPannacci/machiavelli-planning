For the search we use Fast Downward.

Heuristics: https://www.fast-downward.org/Doc/Evaluator
-) blind (1 for non-goal, 0 for goal)
-) alternatively goalcount (counts predicates that don't satisfy goal)
-) ff (h_ff)
-) hmax
-) add (h_add)
-) sum / max are ways of combining heuristics


Algorithms: https://www.fast-downward.org/Doc/SearchAlgorithm
-) astar
-) in general we have seen only the "eager" ones
-) eager_greedy (greedy best-first search)
-) wastar (weighted astar)
