# machiavelli-planning

Project developed for the course of "Planning and Reasoning" during the MSc in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics at Sapienza University of Rome, A.Y. 2024-2025.


## Summary

Implementation in PDDL and IndiGolog of a task from the [italian card game Machiavelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machiavelli_(Italian_card_game)).

We take into consideration a single turn of a player during the course of the game. The goal is to check whether itâ€™s possible for the player to win from the current configuration (board state and player's hand) and, in the positive case, to find a sequence of legal actions that do so.

In the case of PDDL we can search for an optimal plan instead of a satisfying one, with the purpose of finding the sequence of actions that is the easiest to execute for a human player. In the case of IndiGolog instead we consider the existence of toy exogenous actions to study the behaviour of the controllers in a dynamic environment.
